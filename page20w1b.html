                        <p>"A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of time. 
                            I, a barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery. 
                            After more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all recall, 
                            but it isn't hard to image what must have happened. At one time, Ts'ui Pen must have said; 
                            'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am retiring to construct a maze.' 
                            Everyone assumed these were separate activities. No one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same. 
                            The Pavilion of the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden. 
                            This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
