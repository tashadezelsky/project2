                        <p>For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my desperate intent. 
                            At once I realized that this would be impossible. 
                            The advice about turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for 
                            finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths. I know something about labyrinths. 
                            Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. 
                            He was Governor of Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than there are in the Hung Lou Meng, 
                            and to create a maze in which all men would lose themselves. 
                            He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was assassinated by a stranger. 
                            His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his labyrinth.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
