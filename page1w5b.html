                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>In the midst of my hatred and terror 
                        (now that it no longer matters to me to speak of terror, now that I have outwitted Richard Madden, 
                        now that my neck hankers for the hangman's noose), 
                        I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that I possessed the Secret - 
                        the name of the exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and, 
                        absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of France, 
                        shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs. If only my mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, 
                        could shout this name in such a way that it could be heard in Germany... My voice, my human voice, was weak. 
                        How could it reach the ear of the Chief? 
                        The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me except that we were in Staffordshire. 
                        A man who, sitting in his arid Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from us. 
                        I said aloud, "I must flee." </p>
