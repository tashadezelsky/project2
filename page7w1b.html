                        <p>"Precisely," said Albert. 
                            "The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game, or parable, in which the subject is time. 
                            The rules of the game forbid the use of the word itself. 
                            To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases and obvious paraphrases, 
                            is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it. 
                            This, then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every meandering of his interminable novel. 
                            I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, 
                            I have worked out the plan from this chaos, I have restored, or believe I have restored, the original. 
                            I have translated the whole work. I can state categorically that not once has the word time been used in the whole book.</p>

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
