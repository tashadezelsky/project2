                            "A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, 
                            "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor of his native province, learned in astronomy, 
                            in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the canonical books, a chess player, 
                            a famous poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth. 
                            He gave up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, 
                            and even of erudition, and shut himself up in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years. 
                            At his death, his heirs found only a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless know, 
                            wished to consign them to the fire, but the executor of the estate - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - 
                            insisted on their publication."

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
