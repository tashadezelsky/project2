                        <p>"Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 
                            'I leave to various future times, 
                            but not to all, my garden of forking paths: 
                            I had no sooner read this, than I understood. 
                            The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself. 
                            The phrase 'to various future times, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, 
                            not in space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. In all fiction, 
                            when a man is faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others. 
                            In the almost unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them. 
                            He thus creates various futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out and bifurcate in other times. 
                            This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance.

                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
