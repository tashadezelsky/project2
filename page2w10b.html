                <p>Albert rose from his seat. 
                    He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high writing cabinet. 
                    For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready. 
                    I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. 
                    I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning</p>

                    <p>.Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out. 
                        The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab. 
                        I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, 
                        I felt infinitely visible and vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. 
                        I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.</p>
