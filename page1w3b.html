                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>I went up to my bedroom. 
                        Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the door. 
                        I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back. 
                        The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky. 
                        It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be that of my implacable death. 
                        In despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now? </p>
