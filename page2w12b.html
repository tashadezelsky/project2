                <p>Albert rose from his seat. 
                    He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high writing cabinet. 
                    For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready. 
                    I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. 
                    I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning</p>

                    <p>From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. 
                        I told myself that the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my adversary in his first attack - 
                        even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate. I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory. 
                        I argued that it was not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, I would be in prison or dead. 
                        I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful conclusion. 
                        From my weakness I drew strength that never left me. </p>
