                        <p>With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, 
                            although perhaps with less admiration for them in themselves than for the fact that they had been thought out by one of my own blood, 
                            and that a man of a distant empire had given them back to me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, 
                            on a Western island. I remember the final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command: 
                            "Thus the heroes fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to killing and to dying."

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
