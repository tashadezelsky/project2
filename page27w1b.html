                        <p>Meditating thus I arrived at a high, 
                            rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. 
                            Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: 
                            the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. 
                            I do not remember whether there was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. 
                            The stuttering sparks of the music kept on.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
