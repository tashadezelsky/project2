                        <p>I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky plan to an end. 
                            It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. 
                            I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous country is of no importance to me, 
                            particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy. 
                            Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. 
                            I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
