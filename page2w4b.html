                <p>Albert rose from his seat. 
                    He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high writing cabinet. 
                    For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready. 
                    I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once.

                        There are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to me... 
                        The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end to these wandering thoughts.</p>
