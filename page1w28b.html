                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>"Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite. 
                        I could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. 
                        A volume whose last page would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely. 
                        I recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen Scheherezade, 
                        through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell the story of The Thousand and One Nights, 
                        with the risk of again arriving at the night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity. 
                        I also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father to son, 
                        to which each individual would add a new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders. 

                        "These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest application to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. 
                        At this point, I was sent from Oxford the manuscript you have just seen. </p>
