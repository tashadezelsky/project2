                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>"The explanation is obvious. 
                        The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete yet not false, 
                        of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer, 
                        your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, 
                        in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging and parallel times. 
                        This web of time - the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries - 
                        embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in others I do, 
                        and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. 
                        In another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these very same words, but am an error, a phantom."
