                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>"Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no one could find the labyrinth. 
                        The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth. 

                        Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem. 
                        First, the curious legend that Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, 
                        a fragment of a letter which I discovered." </p>
