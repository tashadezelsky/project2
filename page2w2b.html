                <p>Albert rose from his seat. 
                    He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high writing cabinet. 
                    For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready. 
                    I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. 
                    I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning</p>

                    <p>... and I hung up the phone. 
                        Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in German. 
                        It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, 
                        meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, 
                        or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. 
                        1 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk. Madden was implacable. 
                        Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable. An Irishman in the service of England, 
                        a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: 
                        the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany? </p>
