                <p>Albert rose from his seat. 
                    He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high writing cabinet. 
                    For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready. 
                    I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. 
                    I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning</p>

                    <p>I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering at me. 
                        Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty out my pockets. 
                        I found just what I knew I was going to find. The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, 
                        the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, 
                        a letter which I decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single shillings and some pennies, 
                        a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, 
                        to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.</p>
