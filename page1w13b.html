                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will be left. 
                        To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, 
                        should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past. 

                        Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, 
                        and watched the diffuse coming of night.
                    
                        The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. 
                        It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field. 
                        No one called the name of a station. 
                        "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform. 
                        "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out.</p>
