                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. 
                        One of them asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?" 
                        Without waiting for my answer, another said: 
                        "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad." 
                        I threw them a coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a slight incline, the road ran downhill. 
                        It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep me company.</p>
