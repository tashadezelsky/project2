                        <p>With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. 
                            In the first, an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. 
                            The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, 
                            and so they won the battle easily. In the second, the same army passes through a palace where a banquet is in progress. 
                            The splendor of the feast remained a memory throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance.
