                        <p>In the midst of my hatred and terror 
                            (now that it no longer matters to me to speak of terror, now that I have outwitted Richard Madden, 
                            now that my neck hankers for the hangman's noose), 
                            I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that I possessed the Secret - 
                            the name of the exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and, 
                            absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of France, 
                            shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs. If only my mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, 
                            could shout this name in such a way that it could be heard in Germany... My voice, my human voice, was weak. 
                            How could it reach the ear of the Chief? 
                            The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me except that we were in Staffordshire. 
                            A man who, sitting in his arid Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from us. 
                            I said aloud, "I must flee."

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
