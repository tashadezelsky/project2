                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                        "I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. 
                        I do not find it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric. 
                        In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, it was a despised one. 
                        Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of letters who, doubtless, 
                        considered himself more than a mere novelist. The testimony of his contemporaries attests to this, 
                        and certainly the known facts of his life confirm his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical. 
                        Philosophical conjectures take up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all problems, 
                        none disquieted him more, and none concerned him more than the profound one of time. Now then, 
                        this is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden. 
                        He does not even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be explained?"
