                <p>Albert rose from his seat. 
                    He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high writing cabinet. 
                    For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready. 
                    I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. 
                    I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning</p>

                    <p>I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. 
                        The train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine. 
                        There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages. I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, 
                        a youth deep in Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier. 

                        At last the train pulled out. 
                        A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform. 
                        It was Captain Richard Madden. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the seat, 
                        as far as possible from the fearful window.</p>
