                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. 
                        In the first, an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. 
                        The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, 
                        and so they won the battle easily. In the second, the same army passes through a palace where a banquet is in progress. 
                        The splendor of the feast remained a memory throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.
