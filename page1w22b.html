                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said, 
                        remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard. 
                        There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later, 
                        he told me he had been a missionary in Tientsin before he "had aspired to become a Sinologist." 

                        We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window and to a large circular clock. 
                        I calculated that my pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in less than an hour. 
                        My irrevocable decision could wait </p>
