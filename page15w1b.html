                        <p>"Fang, let us say, has a secret. 
                            A stranger knocks at his door. 
                            Fang makes up his mind to kill him. 
                            Naturally there are various possible outcomes. 
                            Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can kill Fang, 
                            both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. 
                            In Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, 
                            each one being the point of departure for other bifurcations. 
                            Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge. 
                            For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy; in others my friend.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
