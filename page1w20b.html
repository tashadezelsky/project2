                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language. 

                        "I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. 
                        No doubt you want to see the garden?" 
                        
                        Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. 
                        
                        "The garden?"

                        Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: 
                        
                        "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."
