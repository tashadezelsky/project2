                        <p>Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. 
                            I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; 
                            I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite, 
                            made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms ... 
                            I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, 
                            ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars. 

                            Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted. 
                            For an undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator. 
                            The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the evening, stirred within me. 
                            Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
