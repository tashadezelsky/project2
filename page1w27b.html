                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. 
                        He opened the top drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet. 
                        He returned holding in his hand a piece of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded with the passage of time: 
                        it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular. Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly famous. Eagerly, but without understanding, 
                        I read the words which a man of my own blood had written with a small brush: "I leave to various future times, but not to all, 
                        my garden of forking paths." 

                        I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went on:</p>
