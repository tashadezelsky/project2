                        <p>From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. 
                            I told myself that the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my adversary in his first attack - 
                            even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate. I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory. 
                            I argued that it was not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, I would be in prison or dead. 
                            I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful conclusion. 
                            From my weakness I drew strength that never left me.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
