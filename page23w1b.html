                        <p>Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said, 
                            remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard. 
                            There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later, 
                            he told me he had been a missionary in Tientsin before he "had aspired to become a Sinologist." 

                            We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window and to a large circular clock. 
                            I calculated that my pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in less than an hour. 
                            My irrevocable decision could wait.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
