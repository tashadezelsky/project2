                            No doubt you want to see the garden?" 
                            
                            Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. 
                            
                            "The garden?"

                            Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: 
                            
                            "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance.
