                        <p>"Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite. 
                            I could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. 
                            A volume whose last page would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely. 
                            I recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen Scheherezade, 
                            through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell the story of The Thousand and One Nights, 
                            with the risk of again arriving at the night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity. 
                            I also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father to son, 
                            to which each individual would add a new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders. 

                            "These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest application to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. 
                            At this point, I was sent from Oxford the manuscript you have just seen.

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
