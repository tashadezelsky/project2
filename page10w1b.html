                            "I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. 
                            I do not find it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric. 
                            In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, it was a despised one. 
                            Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of letters who, doubtless, 
                            considered himself more than a mere novelist. The testimony of his contemporaries attests to this, 
                            and certainly the known facts of his life confirm his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical. 
                            Philosophical conjectures take up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all problems, 
                            none disquieted him more, and none concerned him more than the profound one of time. Now then, 
                            this is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden. 
                            He does not even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be explained?"

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
