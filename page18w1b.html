                        <p>Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. 
                            He opened the top drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet. 
                            He returned holding in his hand a piece of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded with the passage of time: 
                            it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular. Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly famous. Eagerly, but without understanding, 
                            I read the words which a man of my own blood had written with a small brush: "I leave to various future times, but not to all, 
                            my garden of forking paths." 

                            I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went on:

                    <p> In his A History of the World War (page 212), 
                        Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, 
                        supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, 
                        against the German line at Serre-Montauban, 
                        scheduled for July 24, 1916, 
                        had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. 
                        He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - 
                        which lacked any special significance. 
                        The following deposition, dictated by, read over, 
                        and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, 
                        casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.</p>
