                        <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. 
                            Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                            Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
                            The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                            Yesterday it was bombed. 
                            I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the 
                            murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. 
                            The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. 
                            He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, 
                            the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. 
                            He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

                    <p>"Fang, let us say, has a secret. 
                        A stranger knocks at his door. 
                        Fang makes up his mind to kill him. 
                        Naturally there are various possible outcomes. 
                        Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can kill Fang, 
                        both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. 
                        In Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, 
                        each one being the point of departure for other bifurcations. 
                        Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge. 
                        For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy; in others my friend.
